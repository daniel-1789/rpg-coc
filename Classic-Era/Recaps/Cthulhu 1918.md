Cthulhu 1918

## Reanimation
### Locale: Martin's Beach Hotel, October 1918
### Investigator:
- Mickey Davis, Private Investigator
- Dina Levitt, Investigative Reporter
- Thaddeus McHenry, Book Dealer

The investigators were among many suffering from the Influenza Pandemic raging through Massachusetts in autumn of 1918. The three were, along with many others, being treated at the Martin's Beach Hotel, converted into a makeshift hospital. 

On the night of Monday, October 7, Milton Jones, veteran of the Civil War, succumbed to the Grippe. They heard his body wheeled away and transported down the cliffside to the makeshift morgue at the beach. However, that night Jones returned - still dead, but reanimated. He tore apart another patient but the three were able to stop him from committing further harm.

Doctor Thomas B. North did his best to convince the three Jones had not truly died, they were mistaken. However, Florence Eastman, wife of another doctor and an experienced nurse herself, confirmed they were correct. Though she too was now severely ill.

Another nurse, Jessica Carter, met with the three in the dining room later that morning as the sun began rising. She explained this resembled something she had witnessed near the turn of the century, when a typhus epidemic ravaged Arkham. North was a student then and greatly admired his fellow student, a Doctor Herbert West, who treated patients that others had sworn had already died. 

The three tried to take a look at the morgue but were stopped by an orderly, Jonathan DeWitt. They snuck to the basement and took nurses and orderly uniforms to allow them to better blend in. Making their way to the morgue they found a chamber of horrors, with patents they knew to be dead screaming in agony, chained to examining tables. North and DeWitt snuck in behind them and tried to subdue them with sedatives but to no avail, with the three scuffling with them, Levitt with her pistol and Davis and McHenry using makeshift weapons. Knocking DeWitt unconscious they unleashed one of the reanimated corpses - one that screamed North had done this to him - and left North to his creations. They then burned the morgue down.

With all the deaths the police made only the most cursory of investigations. That next night Nurse Eastman expired as well, but she did not reanimate...



## The Darkness Beneath the Hill
### Locale: Providence, Rhode Island, November 1918
### Investigators:
- Mickey Davis, Private Investigator
- Dina Levitt, Investigative Reporter
- Thaddeus McHenry, Book Dealer

The investigators were called upon by McHenry's college friend, Josh Winscott, who had found secret tunnels underneath a home dating back to colonial times that he had just inherited.

Doing a little research they discovered the tunnels were discovered by an ancestor, Elijah Winscott, who had used them in an attempt to continue the slave trade after it had been banned in Rhode Island. His first attempt was a disaster, with everyone lost, slavers and enslaved alike.

While they were supposed to meet with him the next morning, they discovered he had gone exploring without them. That had proven unwise as the trio followed. They encountered degenerate descendants of the slavers and enslaved, mixed with something nonhuman. They seemed more frightened of the investigators. However, horrific creatures that oversaw them were not as passive, with their long claws and razor teeth. The three found themselves fleeing in the labyrinth of caverns.

While down there they learned the slavers and enslaved had been ambushed by serpent-men that had been sleeping for eons but had awoken. They captured the humans and used them as slaves and breeding experiments. At a temple to Yith Levitt found herself in connection to an ancient god of the serpent-men. Finally they found one of those serpent-men, with an imprisoned (and near insane) Josh, along with two infants of the degenerate descendants. With clubs and firearms they slew the vile serpent-man and made use of a mystical gateway that took them outside Providence before more of the overseers could catch them - or awaken more serpent-men.

### Capsule Summary
The investigators get caught in the Great Molasses Flood while looking for a missing anarchist. 

They learned he had miscast a binding of a Formless Spawn which killed him and hid in the Molasses Tank. When the tank ruptured it explored the city. 

The tome was stolen from the Church of the Sacred Heart. Working their way past protesters they learned a young anarchist priest had assisted in the theft. 

At the church of the Sacred Heart they battled both anarchists and a Formless Spawn. 

In the battle Mickey and Dina fell. Thaddeus retired to become the patron of later investigators.

## The Haunting
### Locale: Boston, Massachusetts, February 1919
### Investigators:
- Detective Mulligan, Boston Police Detective
- Donald Key, Museum Curator
- Rosa Shapiro, Nurse

The investigators were enlisted by Thaddeus McHenry to investigate a supposedly haunted house that he had inherited.

In the investigation they learned it was a part of the Chapel of Contemplation and its early owner, Mr. Walter Corbitt, was hidden in an undead state in the basement. Battling his animations they destroyed his physical form.

They enlisted Rev Vittorio Gregori to try exorcising the house prior to their confrontation - it didn't quite work, but it did give Rosa an opportunity to learn what had befallen Dina.
