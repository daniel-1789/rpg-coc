## The Hunt
AD 998, December

This month saw a wolf terrorizing the land around Totburh. Thegn Oswyn tasked his people with retrieving the wolf’s pelt. Three of the burh traveled to Eorhelm’s farm - the stonemason, Cuthbert; the cunning woman, Saga, daughter of Northmen settlers; and Wulfstan, a mighty warrior. It had been some time since any had heard from the farm.

The three arrived at the farm as the sun was setting. At the farm they saw much horror. The door to Eorhelm’s small farmhouse had been broken off and was atop Eorhelm’s broken body. His wife, Angifu, had been gutted by some beast. The cradle for their infant son, Inric, was missing. 

Outside, in the light snow, there were tracks visible. Wolf tracks, partially obscuring smaller prints, headed east while other, more normal prints, went south back to Totburh. As they investigated they encountered Eorhelm’s slave, Ealhaf, wandering around, his mind enfeebled, muttering “wæl-wulf” and Inric. Looking closer, they found drops of blood along the path to the east.

Before the trio could depart the corpse of Angifu arose and tried to smite the living. Only by severing its head could they end its rampage.

They followed the trail to the east. Though they considered delaying until the dawn, the blood in the trail made them consider the possibility the infant might still live. 

Along the trail Wulfstan and Cuthbert caught sight of a massive tree with a shimmering pond at its base, though Saga simply saw an empty clearing. Going closer, the two saw an old crone and bones - children’s bones - hanging from the tree branches. She told them the bones were those of children she could not save. She lunged forward and grabbed Wulfstan and Cuthbert. Her hood fell back, revealing a star-filled void instead of a face. They then found themselves in a field with a hundred soldiers in metal armor being attacked by a handful of small men. A massive wolf attacked the armored men. The crone then vanished into the tree - then the entire vision vanished and all that was there was a clearing. Which is all Saga ever saw.

Continuing on the three ran afoul of Edric the Bloodhand, a local outlaw, along with four of his men. However, seeing dangerous armed foes, the group retreated without robbing them.

The tracks eventually took the three to a strange village inhabited by small goat-men. In the center of the village was a metal pole with a mirror atop it - and at its base an altar with a wolf skull. The mirror flared to life despite the darkness, reflecting the light of the full moon - and directing it at two massive wolves. The goat-men placed an infant at the altar and one of the wolves approached it. The three charged. Wulfstan realized the moonlight was giving power to the wolves and worked at toppling the pole. An eldritch tentacle from the first wolf brutally maimed Cuthbert who crawled away. As Wulfstan toppled the pole the tentacles faded - the wolves remained huge but less powerful. One was still in the distance so Wulfstan and Saga dispatched it. They engaged the second in a battle - and the wolf began healing, as the goatmen were pushing the pole back up. The injured Cuthbert chased them away and pulled the pole back down, allowing the other two to finish the second wolf.

They then retrieved the infant, took their wolf pelts, and returned to Totburh. They were held in great esteem by the folk of Totburh. Oswyn granted each a horse and a blade and Saga took the infant to raise herself.
