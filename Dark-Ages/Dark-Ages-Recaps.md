## The Hunt
AD 998, December

This month saw a wolf terrorizing the land around Totburh. Thegn Oswyn tasked his people with retrieving the wolf’s pelt. Three of the burh traveled to Eorhelm’s farm - the stonemason, Cuthbert; the cunning woman, Saga, daughter of Northmen settlers; and Wulfstan, a mighty warrior. It had been some time since any had heard from the farm.

The three arrived at the farm as the sun was setting. At the farm they saw much horror. The door to Eorhelm’s small farmhouse had been broken off and was atop Eorhelm’s broken body. His wife, Angifu, had been gutted by some beast. The cradle for their infant son, Inric, was missing. 

Outside, in the light snow, there were tracks visible. Wolf tracks, partially obscuring smaller prints, headed east while other, more normal prints, went south back to Totburh. As they investigated they encountered Eorhelm’s slave, Ealhaf, wandering around, his mind enfeebled, muttering “wæl-wulf” and Inric. Looking closer, they found drops of blood along the path to the east.

Before the trio could depart the corpse of Angifu arose and tried to smite the living. Only by severing its head could they end its rampage.

They followed the trail to the east. Though they considered delaying until the dawn, the blood in the trail made them consider the possibility the infant might still live. 

Along the trail Wulfstan and Cuthbert caught sight of a massive tree with a shimmering pond at its base, though Saga simply saw an empty clearing. Going closer, the two saw an old crone and bones - children’s bones - hanging from the tree branches. She told them the bones were those of children she could not save. She lunged forward and grabbed Wulfstan and Cuthbert. Her hood fell back, revealing a star-filled void instead of a face. They then found themselves in a field with a hundred soldiers in metal armor being attacked by a handful of small men. A massive wolf attacked the armored men. The crone then vanished into the tree - then the entire vision vanished and all that was there was a clearing. Which is all Saga ever saw.

Continuing on the three ran afoul of Edric the Bloodhand, a local outlaw, along with four of his men. However, seeing dangerous armed foes, the group retreated without robbing them.

The tracks eventually took the three to a strange village inhabited by small goat-men. In the center of the village was a metal pole with a mirror atop it - and at its base an altar with a wolf skull. The mirror flared to life despite the darkness, reflecting the light of the full moon - and directing it at two massive wolves. The goat-men placed an infant at the altar and one of the wolves approached it. The three charged. Wulfstan realized the moonlight was giving power to the wolves and worked at toppling the pole. An eldritch tentacle from the first wolf brutally maimed Cuthbert who crawled away. As Wulfstan toppled the pole the tentacles faded - the wolves remained huge but less powerful. One was still in the distance so Wulfstan and Saga dispatched it. They engaged the second in a battle - and the wolf began healing, as the goatmen were pushing the pole back up. The injured Cuthbert chased them away and pulled the pole back down, allowing the other two to finish the second wolf.

They then retrieved the infant, took their wolf pelts, and returned to Totburh. They were held in great esteem by the folk of Totburh. Oswyn granted each a horse and a blade and Saga took the infant to raise herself.

## The Doom That Came to Wessex
AD 999, March

The spring of the year 999 began well in Totburh. Hothere,
the almoner from St. Swithun’s, was making one of his frequent visits. He and three other monks come to Totburh periodically to speak with the priests and
anyone who might need their guidance. 

That night, Saga, Cuthbert, and Wulfstan caught sight of a pyre lit on a nearby hill - a Viking ship was attacking. They sounded the alarm, with all the churches of the burh ringing their bells.

Cuthbert and Wulfstan did battle atop the walls, stopping the Vikings from getting into the burh. Saga tended to the many injured - including treating some of the wounded Vikings, for they could be ransomed back to their settlement.

Oswyn dispatched the bulk of the hearthweru to pursue the Vikings. However, Hothere brought word that the monastery was under attack as well. Cuthbert, Wulfstan, and Saga accompanied Hothere back to the monastery.  

Dawn was still some two hours away when they reached the monastery - parts of it on fire and there was an overall red glow. They saw Vikings and monks doing bizarre acts - and with time, they realized each of the afflicted was acting out one of the seven deadly sins. Saga stopped a monk from raping a slave woman. They saw other Vikings and monks eating or lounging together - and others fighting. One monk, Jurmin, approached them filled with wrath. 

They encountered a merchant, Mousoulios, who claimed to be the the greatest trader ever. He showed them a cask he had brought the monks. It had written on it in Greek (he translated for them) - “I am called Phêth. I make
men consumptive and cause hemorrhagia”. 

The abbott, Abbot Grimcytel was in his cell, staring at the walls. The
phrase, “Relinquo totus spes” written in blood covered the walls,
over and over. “Abandon all hope.” Grimcytel, upon being prodded, kept repeating “Tuatame
ex infernis” meaning, “liberate me from the fire.” He then murmured they should speak with Hygerd.

As the sun rose, they returned to Totburh and at midday consulted with Hygerd, forever dwelling in his cell at Halfdene’s church. When told of Phêth he said:
> > The monastery burns! It burns in the sweet smell of Pan’s pissings. And lo, I am King Solomon, come to render unto thee. I am the master of the air, the earth, the flame, and the wave.
> The red glow is his coming. The twenty-seventh of Lord Sabaoth.
> Bathed in the pressing of uva Phêth has come. If one exorcise me
> in wine, sweet-smelling and unmixed by the eleventh aeon, and
> say: ‘I exorcise thee by the eleventh aeon to stop, I demand, Phêth,’
> then give it to the patient to drink, and I at once retreat. Bathed
> in the blood of many, he lurks below.

Though not all made sense, and was overall somewhat damaging to their lucidity, they understood enough to acquire unmixed wine from Oswyn. They returned to the monastery at dusk and were able to use the incantation and unmixed wine to exorcise the demon Phêth. However, there was much damage. Many monks were dead, much of the monastery was burned, and the Vikings were still inclined to raid. At the very least, the Vikings were persuaded to seek easier prey.
