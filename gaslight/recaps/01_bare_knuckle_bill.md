# The Curious Case of Bare-Knuckle Bill

## Thursday, January 19, 1888

Hudson & Brand had been missing for several months. With that, their last will and testement had been read and the agency assigned to Lady Celeste Howard, late of Her Majesty’s intelligence services. She was ably assisted by hansom and urban explorer Bumstead Isbahd and antiquarian Colin McKenzie.

On a Thursday morning dominated by light sleet and occasional dull sunlight they took on their first case, for a young street urchin, Albert “Albie” Barrett, who had been working for the prizefighter Bare-Knuckle Bill, who had gone missing after his fight last night. Albie suspected the Irish gang known as the Greens might be involved, having heard them threatening him at the Lamberth Cooper’s Yard the last fish had been at.

The three rode with young Albie to the yard and confirmed from witnesses that none had seen Bill leave the place. They explored the abandoned yard, breaking into a side door - and discovering some primitive but effective traps. They eventually found a hidden tunnel underground, leading to a strange tunnel complex. They explored it until they heard the roaring of a great cat - a tiger. Deciding discretion was the better part of valor and tried departing, only to discover the exit had been barricaded behind them.

Forced to continue in the tunnels by the dim kerosene lamps they were using they found themselves doing battle with a tiger. Eventually they shot it dead, though not before it was able to do a fair amount of damage to the three. 

In the tunnel complex they found the remains of Mr. Brand, devoured by the tiger. The tunnels eventually led to a strange club house, the House of Dark Mysteries, that they learned was dedicated to “the Lady”. Their attempts at stealth foiled, they allowed the staff to escort them to the chambers of the Lady. The chamber was guarded by a hulking brute, Mr Seems. Inside the chamber was the leader of the Greens, Brian O’Riordan, and a strange, possibly undead or extra dimensional woman known as “The Lady”. Also there was a strange chimera of animated corpses, including the unfortunate Mr Hudson. Also there was Bare-Knuckle Bill, awaiting his sacrifice to The Lady. Unable to reach an accord with the Lady, gunfire quickly followed. She was inhuman, her head showing signs of having been stapled atop her form. She levitated above the floor and tried to convince them with the power of her mind to join the chimera. Eventually they dealt with O’Riordan, Seems, and The Lady, fortunately discovering her vulnerability to sunlight (and more fortunately the sunlight had ended well enough to have an effect on her).

The three worked with police constable to clean up the strange Hall. At both the Hall and the Cooper’s Yard they found the handiwork of the Greens and the Heligoland Trading Company. What was the trading company’s connection with the Greens? And with the strange Lady? Had they dealt with her permanent? Time would tell…
